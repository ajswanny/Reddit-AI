# Reddit AI
The source code for the research project in which a collection of Python programs were used to identify levels of awareness about the hurrican disaster in Puerto Rico – which occurred in September 2017 – and attempt to increase them via a dialog agent (a Reddit bot).

Making use of data analysis, a conversational agent is put to use that scans reddit posts and their comments.  The agents program used the analyzed data to make a decision: could it bring about conversation about Hurrican Maria in a particular post's comment section? If so, the program fed the agent one of several manually crafted phrases for it to post as a comment –– this was one of the several strategies used in the throughout the course of the research project.
