# Reddit AI
The source code for the research project in which a collection of Python programs were used to identify levels of awareness about the hurrican disaster in Puerto Rico – which occurred in September 2017 – and attempt to increase them via a dialog agent (a Reddit bot).

#### Project Abstract
*On September 20, 2017 hurricane “Maria” made landfall in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. The hurricane’s devastation maintained its impact for several months after September 20 and still does. The lack of adequate assistance given to the government of Puerto Rico for hurricane relief became concerning; efforts to denounce these realities or contribute to benefaction did not appear sufficient during the months immediately after the storm. This project aimed at raising the awareness of this situation in Puerto Rico by using a weak-AI agent charged with the task of spreading details about the situation. The task was carried out through three different experimental approaches for creating contents about the humanitarian crisis in the form of Reddit submissions and comments. These approaches showed good potential but stopped short of showing the expected results as desired, thus suggesting migration to other online social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.*
